# WaybackX
A project I worked on as part of my internship at Bibliotheca Alexandrina's IT department.<br>
Wayback Machine lets viewers browse through the web archive, which is a web crawler that provides screenshots of<br>
websites at particular dates. This project's purpose was to generate a random page for the user to view.<br>
This project is implemented using Java **Spring Boot** framework.
